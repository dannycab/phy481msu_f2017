What is the physical interpretation of $\oint \mathbf{A} \cdot d\mathbf{l}$?

1. The current density $\mathbf{J}$
2. The magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$
3. The magnetic flux $\Phi_B$
4. It's none of the above, but is something simple and concrete
5. It has no particular physical interpretation at all

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C

The force on a segment of wire $L$ is $\mathbf{F} = I \mathbf{L} \times \mathbf{B}$ A current-carrying wire loop is in a constant magnetic field $\mathbf{B} = B \hat{z}$ as shown. What is the direction of the torque on the loop?

1. Zero
2. +x
3. +y
4. +z
5. None of these

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B

<section data-markdown>

The torque on a magnetic dipole in a B field is:

$\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}$

How will a small current loop line up if the B field points uniformly up the page?

Suppose I place a small dipole $\mathbf{M}$ at various locations near the end of a large solenoid. At which point is the magnitude of the force on the dipole greatest?

<img src="./images/force_on_mag_dipole.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>


D) Not enough information to answer

E) There is no net force on a dipole

Recall: $\mathbf{F} = \nabla (\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B})$

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
