Which charge distributions below produce a potential that looks like $\frac{C}{r^2}$ when you are far away?

E) None of these, or more than one of these!

(For any which you did not select, how DO they behave at large r?)

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E (Both C and D)

In terms of the multipole expansion $V(r) = V(mono) + V(dip) + V(quad) + \dots$, the following charge distribution has the form:

<img src="./images/multipole_charge_configs_3.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>

1. $V(r) = V(mono) + V(dip) +\;$ higher order terms
2. $V(r) = V(dip) +\;$ higher order terms
3. $V(r) = V(dip)$
4. $V(r) =\;$ only higher order terms than dipole
5. No higher terms, $V(r) = 0$ for this one.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
