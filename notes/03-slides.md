You are trying to compute the work done by a force, $\mathbf{F} = a\hat{x} + x\hat{y}$, along the line $y=2x$ from $\langle 0,0 \rangle$ to $\langle 1,2 \rangle$. What is $d\mathbf{l}$?

1. $dl$
2. $dx\;\hat{x}$
3. $dy\;\hat{y}$
4. $2dx\;\hat{x}$
5. Something else

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: E
* It's $dx\;\hat{x}+dy\;\hat{y}$.

You are trying to compute the work done by a force, $\mathbf{F} = a\hat{x} + x\hat{y}$, along the line $y=2x$ from $\langle 0,0 \rangle$ to $\langle 1,2 \rangle$. Given that $d\mathbf{l} = dx\;\hat{x}+dy\;\hat{y}$, which of the following forms of the integral is correct?

1. $\int_0^1 a\;dx + \int_0^2 x\;dy$
2. $\int_0^1 (a\;dx + 2x\;dx)$
3. $\frac{1}{2} \int_0^2 (a\;dy + y\;dy)$
4. More than one is correct

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: D
* All are correct forms, but B and C are ready to integrate.

A certain fluid has a velocity field given by $\mathbf{v} = x\hat{x} + z \hat{y}$. Which component(s) of the field contributed to "fluid flux" integral ($\int_S \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$) through the x-z plane?

1. $v_x$
2. $v_y$
3. both
4. neither

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: B
* Only the vector perpendicular to the surface will contribute

For the same fluid with velocity field given by $\mathbf{v} = x\hat{x} + z \hat{y}$. What is the value of the "fluid flux" integral ($\int_S \mathbf{v}\cdot d\mathbf{A}$) through the entire x-y plane?

1. It is zero
2. It is something finite
3. It is infinite
4. I can't tell without doing the integral

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: A
* The velocity field is parallel to the x-y plane every where and hence contributes no flux through the surface.

A rod (radius $R$) with a hole (radius $r$) drilled down its entire length $L$ has a mass density of $\frac{\rho_0\phi}{\phi_0}$ (where $\phi$ is the normal polar coordinate).

To find the total mass of this rod, which coordinate system should be used (take note that the mass density varies as a function of angle):

1. Cartesian ($x,y,z$)
2. Spherical ($r,\phi,\theta$)
3. Cylindrical ($s, \phi, z$)
4. It doesn't matter, just pick one.

Note:
* CORRECT ANSWER: C
* It makes the most sense from the geometry of the problem and writing the limits.

The trapezoidal rule for a function $f(x)$ gives the area of the $k$th slice of width $h$ to be,

$$A_{k} = \frac{1}{2}h\left(f(a+(k-1)h) + f(a+kh)\right)$$

What is the approximate integral, $I(a,b) = \int_a^b f(x) dx$, $I(a,b) \approx$

1. $\sum_{k=1}^N \frac{1}{2}h\left(f(a+(k-1)h) + f(a+kh)\right)$
2. $h\left(\frac{1}{2}f(a) + \frac{1}{2}f(b) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{k=1}^{N-1}f(a+kh)\right)$
3. $h\left(\frac{1}{2}f(a) + \frac{1}{2}f(b) + \sum_{k=1}^{N-1}f(a+kh)\right)$
4. None of these is correct.
4. More than one is correct.

<section data-markdown>

The trapezoidal rule takes into account the value and slope of the function. The next "best" approximation will also take into account:

1. Concavity of the function
2. Curvature of the function
3. Unequally spaced intervals
4. More than one of these
5. Something else entirely
