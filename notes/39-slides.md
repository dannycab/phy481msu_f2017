The torque on a magnetic dipole in a B field is:

$\mathbf{\tau} = \mathbf{m} \times \mathbf{B}$

How will a small current loop line up if the B field points uniformly up the page?

Suppose I place a small dipole $\mathbf{M}$ at various locations near the end of a large solenoid. At which point is the magnitude of the force on the dipole greatest?

<img src="./images/force_on_mag_dipole.png" align="center" style="width: 600px";/>


D) Not enough information to answer

E) There is no net force on a dipole

Recall: $\mathbf{F} = \nabla (\mathbf{m}\cdot\mathbf{B})$
